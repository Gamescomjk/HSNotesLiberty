# Types of maps
 - ### Reference maps 
	 - ##### Political maps - contry bonderies 
	 - ##### Pysical maps - pysical features. 
	 
- ### Thematic maps show **Spatial aspects**  of infomation
	- ###### Maps that plot infomation by color is a example ![[Pasted image 20220914091531.png]]
	- ##### Dot Maps, Mostly used at larger scaled maps ![[Pasted image 20220914091643.png]]
	- ##### Graduated symbol maps. (Is not specfic, due to data overlaping) ![[Pasted image 20220914091823.png]]
	- ##### Isoline Mpas - (Topograpic maps) ![[Pasted image 20220914091915.png]]
	- ##### Cartogram - Data Showed by size (more population meanes the contry is bigger)![[Pasted image 20220914092102.png]]

* ### Location
	- Relative location - can change (go south from 7/11)
	* Ablsoute location - A street name, adress, longitude, laditued. 

- ### Map Projections - All maps have some type of distorstion 

	* Mercator projection - the most common type of map. was used for navigation (Greenland is protayed 14x bigger than africa)
	- Gall-peters projection -  preserved area rather than shape so the area shown would be accrurate but at a comprimized of shape.
	- Winkel triple is a combiation of both.
	- Conic - A interpeted projection where the map preserves area and shape at a cost of the look of the map
	- Robision - Sizes is close to real at a cost of the poles
