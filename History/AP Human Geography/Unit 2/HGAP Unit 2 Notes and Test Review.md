[Population Densities: AP Human Geography (Minecraft Edition)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXKi5fZnH10&list=PL-R0qM-A09uyyvV8u52ucO6LLL8FH_pkQ&index=2)

-   Four main population regions: South Asia (India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka), East Asia (China, Japan, Korean Peninsula), Southeast Asia (Thailand, Philippines, Vietnam), Europe
    

When we look at different population clusters around the world, we can see common themes that revolve around different site and situation factors.

-   Environmental Possibilism: The idea of modifying the physical environment suitable for our needs to make less hospitable areas more hospitable and to overcome the limits that the environment puts on society is called Environmental Possibilism.
    
-   Population Density: The number of people in an area.
    

-   Types of Densities: Arithmetic Density, Physiological Density, Agricultural Density.
    

-   Arithmetic Density: Total Population/Total Amount of Land. If the number is high, more people live near each other; if the number is low, fewer people live in each unit of land.
    
-   Physiological Density: Total Population/Total Amount of Arable Land. Shows how much food is needed to produce from 1 unit of arable land. The higher the number, the more food needed to produce.
    
-   Agricultural Density: Amount of Farmers/Total Amount of Arable Land. It shows how advanced the technology or efficiency of society is in producing food. The higher this number is, the more manual labor a society uses to produce food, indicating less technology being used in agriculture or less effective agricultural practice. The lower this number is, the less human labor is needed, which indicates more efficient agricultural practices.

Unit 2 Topic 2 (2.2):

[Consequences of Population Distribution [AP Human Geography Unit 2 Topic 2]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADGXW7WjtG4&t=15s)

Politicians usually favor larger cities with more population than rural areas, and these areas have less political power than cities.

More densely populated areas have,

-   More jobs
    
-   More economic opportunities
    

businesses concentrate more in these areas for a larger customer base and more workers increasing their efficiency in all other areas and their current chosen location.

  
  

Carrying Capacity: The number of people the environment can support without damaging the environment.

[An Overview Of Population Pyramids [AP Human Geography Unit 2 Topic 3] (2.3)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-ce1AI-uNI&t=9s)

Population pyramids give us a breakdown of society’s sex and age at a given time.

The Y-axis shows different age cohorts, and the x-axis shows the number of people, usually the number of percents (%).

To find Sex Ratio: Number of Male Births/Number of Female Births *100

If the ratio is above 100, then more male births. If below 100, then more female births. If the number is 100, male and female births are equal.

-   Pre-Reproductive years: 0-14 years
    
-   Reproductive Years: 15-44 years
    
-   Post-Reproductive Years: 45 years and above.
    

If most of the population is in the pre-reproductive years or reproductive years, we can then predict that society’s population is going to grow at a much faster rate than a society that has the majority of its population in the post-reproductive years.

If the population pyramid has a large base, the population is growing rapidly. If the pyramid has a large top, the population is rapidly shrinking. If the population pyramid looks more like a box, it means that the society is close to its replacement rate (this shows stability in the growth rate of a society).

To find Dependency Ratio: (Population of children (0-14)+Population of Adults 65+)/Working Age Population * 100

To find Child Dependency Ratio:  (Populationof people aged 0-14 years old/Population) of people aged 15-64 years old * 100

To find Elderly Dependency Ratio:  (Population of people age 65+ years old/Population) of people age 15-64 years old * 100

Unit 2 Topic 4 (2.4):

[Understanding Population Dynamics [AP Human Geography Unit 2 Topic 4]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dw93Ci5Bu54&t=14s)

Crude Birth Rate (CBR): Total number of live births in a year for every 1,000 people alive in a society.

Crude Death Rate (CDR): Total number of deaths in a year for every 1,000 people alive in a society.

Total Fertility Rate (TFR): The average number of children a woman will have. (Depends on the country we are looking at).

Infant Mortality Rate (IMR): The total number of deaths under one year of age in a year for every 1,000 live births.

Natural Increase Rate (NIR): The percentage by which a population grows in a year. (Also referenced as the rate of natural increase).

To find the NIR of a country, we subtract the Crude Death Rate from the Crude Birth Rate (CBR-CDR)

Countries with a high NIR will take less time to double their population.

Events such as the industrial revolution and the medical revolution led to a population boom (might be a question on the test).

Pro-Natalist Policies - Policies that are created to help increase a society's birth rate.

Anti-Natalist Policies - Policies that are created to help decrease a society's birth rate.

Unit 2 Topic 5 (2.5):

[The Demographic Transition Model [AP Human Geography Unit 2 Topic 5]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cre5wwEKiDQ&t=25s)

Demographic Transition Model (DTM): A model that has five different stages and focuses in different economic and social developments of a society. 

Stage 1: In the first stage of this model societies have a high CBR and CDR (Societies in this stage lack medical care and are more based on an agricultural-based Subsistence farming society). There are no countries in the first stage of demographic transition model.

Stage 2: Countries in this stage tend to have a high CBR and CDR but the CDR will gradually decrease causing that country to experience a population boost. During this stage societies mostly concentrate on having better medical care, improve their agricultural production and lower their IMR and CDR. This is the stage where a lot of people start migrating to urban areas seeking more economic opportunities. Europe and North America were among the first regions to enter the second stage of the demographic transition model due to the diffusion of the industrial revolution. Later, other countries started shifting to the second stage due to the further diffusion of technology and the medical revolution. When looking at a population pyramid if most of the population is at the pre-reproductive and reproductive years that means that country is entering stage 2 of  DTM.

Stage 3: CBR and CDR start to decrease now.Most identified with the decrease in CBR and NIR starting recently. People don’t have space or economic need for more population. There may be cultural changes in society and gender roles changing which might lead to women having more power on economy as well. More jobs open up tertiary and manufacture sector of the economy. Less people emigrate from countries at this stage.

Stage 4: Low CBR and CDR. Low to flat NIR. More economic opportunities for citizens, more jobs open up for women as well as more jobs open up in the tertiary sector too. Countries might experience Zero Population Growth (ZPG) meaning that both CBR and CDR for the countries are the same making the NIR to be zero. More people are focused in their jobs leading them to marry lately and have kids later as well. This will lead to smaller family sizes and higher cost of living. This decreases the disposable income for the citizens. Disposable income is the income that a person has left after taxes and other mandatory charges. Access to better health care services and nutritious food. USA and China are good examples of 

Stage 4 Demographic Transition Models since there are almost equal amount of people in all agw cohorts.

Stage 5: Negative NIR. CBR can go below CDR. Japan or Germany are examples since most of their population is at post-reproductive age cohorts which means their population is decreasing.

  

Epidemiological Transition Model (ETM): A branch of medicine which deals with the incidence, distribution, and possible control of diseases and other factors relating to health. Identical to DTM with small differences. Has causes of death for each stage of the DTM.

Stage 1: Defined by Pestilence, Famine & Death (Parasitic Diseases, Infectious Diseases, Animal Attacks, Pandemics, Epidemics, Food Sohrtages, Dirty Water). Most well known killers was the “Bubonic Plague.

Ex: An epidemic is a disease that spreads through a region or a community whereas a Pandemic is a disease that spreads across multiple regions, countries, or even the entire world. Endemic is a disease that stays in a particular area and does not spread through the entire region or community.

Stage 2: Decrease in deaths. Might be due to better medical care and more medicines to cure their problems. Defined by less deaths and receding pandemics. These don’t only help the standard og living but also increase the food production. Societies also start to eat more nutritious food and start practiving sanitation methods. This was the stage when the Industrial Revolution and the Medical Revolution occured. The CDR increased due to these problems but the CBR doesn’t change.

Stage 3: Defined by Degenerative Diseases (a disease that continues to get worse over time like cancer).

Stage 4: Defined by fighting Degenerative Diseases and longer life expectancy. People start improving their diet and make better health decisions.

Stage 5: Remergence of Infectious Diseases: Most of the stages from Stage 1 might return. This might happen due to the evolution of diseases, increased poverty, increased urbanization leading the society to have more pollution and globalization. The CDR start increasing in this stage because the diseases start returning back now. Not only that but individuals might start eating more junk food leading them to be obese. Globalization can also lead to the germs travelling from one part of ragion to the other or even worldwide. This leads to pandemics such as COVID-19. Poverty had more deaths since they had less access to be sanitized.

Unit 2 Topic 6 (2.6):

[Thomas Malthus and Population Growth [AP Human Geography Unit 2 Topic 6]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajd3nr3ysNo&t=18s)

Carrying Capacity: The maximum number of people, animals, or crops that an area can support.

Thomas Malthus: An english economist during the industrial revolution when it was in the stage 2 of the DTM. H e believed that the population will grow at an exponential rate and the production of food will grow arithmetically which would lead to a malthusian crisis eventually. One of the first person to raise doubts about a growing population.

Malthusian Ctastrople. Would occur when the population would exceed the carrying capacity and society would no longer be able to produce enough food to feed it’s citizens.

Malthus is wrong?: Population wil not continue to grow as societies evolve. As countries go through the stages of DTM the population will start to decrease. Not only that, bt the agricultural advancements will help produce more food in less time to feed more population easily while using less land. The present growth is logistic and not exponential.

Malthus was Right: Countries in stage 2 have a population curve resembling the j-curve. 

Neo-Malthusians: People that believe in Malthus’s idea because it’s not only food that is the problem but also the Earth’s resources. These people believe in Malthus’s core idea and expand on it. World has a finite supply of natural resources and as our population grows we will deplete our resources gradually. Some Neo-Malthusians look at climate change, water shortages, desetification and all other changes as evidence that Neo-Malthusians and Malthus are right.

Unit 2 Topic 7 (2.7):

[Government Policies and Population Growth [AP Human Geography Unit 2 Topic 7]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPI_QMbl92o&t=14s)

Government policies and population growth: There are two main policies here. Pro-Natalist Policies and Anti-Natalist Policies. Pro-Natalist Polcies are policies that are created to help increase a society’s birth rate. Anti-Natalist Policies are policies that are created to help decrease a society’s birth rate.

Pro-Natalist Policies: Usually done by using propaganda, offering tax incentives for having more children, offering more resources to feed their family and other bonuses too. This is done to grab the attention of their citizens to have more children by showing them the gift of  money. 

  

Ex. Russia, South Korea, Denmark, and Singapore are using Pro-Natalist policies to increase their population. Countries using these policies usually have a low NIR.

  

Anti-Natalist Policies: Goal is to balance their overpopulation. Also use propaganda to promote that [smaller families are happier families and larger families have more struggles to live.] - shows the difference and shows what and how the government was promoting 

Immgirants policies: Policies based on economic needsand other values to increase their economy. Governments also pass policies to promote immgiration policies. Ex. (USA is a good example of promoting H-1B visa program allowing more skilled workers to enter the country)

Immigration: Having more immigrants can not only help with the economy of a country but it can also help the contry have more diversity, increase their tax base, increase their overall population and have more people looking for a job which leads to the economy having a really good boost. USA again can be an example of all of these benefits listed here.

[Women and Demographic Changes [AP Human Geography Unit 2 Topic 8]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEcXMiWaY0A&t=9s)

Ravenstein’s Laws of Migration

1st Law: Most Migration happens for economic reasons and is done by young adults.

2nd Law: Migrants often travel short distances and will travel in step migration.

3rd Law: Migrants are more likely to move from a rural area to an urban area because an urban area has more job opportunities whereas a rural area is just based in farming and mostly agriculture based economy.

Migration Stream: Whenever migration happens a counter stream is created meaning when a person moves to a new place they connect their original location with the new location. If a person from Texas goes to Massachusetts and tell them how good the weather is in Texas compared to Massachusetts, the other person living in Massachusetts might migrate to Texas because they don’t want to live in the cold. This is a good example of Migration stream.

4th Law: Urban areas tend to grow more through migration than by their natural births because urban areas having a lower TFR. This trend of people moving to larger urban area is also shown in the gravity model which shows that people will be attracted to larger cities even if they are farther away.

Gravity Model: The size of the settlements and the distance between them is factored into the migration pattern.

5th Law: Migration increases economic development. Migration brings new goods, foods, ideas, businesses, and other productive assets with it all of which help the economy of a country grow.

6th Law: Women are more likely to move internally within a country while most international migrants are young males.

Human Migration: The permanent change of residence by an individual or group.

Factors that are taken into consideration when migrating: Push and Pull factors.

Pull Factors: Positive situations, conditions, events, and factors that make people want to move to a geographic location.

Push Factors: Negative situations, conditions, events, and factors that make people want to leave a geographic location.

Emigration: When an individual leaves a country or political territory.

Immigration: When an individual enters a country or political territory.

Intervening Obstacles: Negative situations or events that hinder migration and end up preventing migrants from reaching their final destination. Problems such as restricted access to a particular country or running out of money to complete their migration.

Intervening Opportunities: Positive situations or events that hinder migration and end up preventing migrants from reaching their final destination. Having multiple opportunities pulls a person to stay in that country for more time than their expected stay.

Forced Migration: When the migrant has no other choice but to migrate. This can happen due to human trafficking, forced child labor, child soldiers, slavery are a few reasons people might have to migrate from their current location.

When an individual is forced to emigrate from a country due to war might seek asylum and try to get refugee status. Societies that have violations such as Human rights, sexual orientation, religious beliefs, cultural differences, political beliefs are more likely to have an increased number of refugees.

Refugee: An individual who has been forced to leave their home country and has crossed an international border in order to escape war, persecution, and/or natural disasters.

Asylum-seeker: An individual who is seeking international protection. In countries with individualized procedures, an asylum-seeker is someone whose claim has not yet been finally decided in by the country in which the claim is submitted. Not every asylum-seeker will ultimately be recognized as a refugee, but every refugee was initially an asylum-seeker.

International Displaced Person (IDP): An IDP is an individual who has been forced to flee from their home in order to avoid the effects of armed conflicts, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights, or natural or human-made disasters but has not crossed an internationally recognized state border. (Source: United Nations Refugee Agency & the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement.

  

Voluntary Migration: When people are willing to leave their home country in their will. This happens mostly due to factors such as economic, social, political, or environmental push and pull factors.

Transnational Migration: A migrant emigrates from their home country to another country but remains connected to their original country.

Chain Migration: A process in which a legal immigrant, who has become a naturalized citizen, sponsors a family member to immigrate to the country.

Naturalization: An individual may qualify for naturalization if they are at least 18 years old and have been a permanent resident for at least 5 years (or 3 years if you are married to a U.S. citizen) and meet all other eligibility requirements.

Step Migration: Migration that happens in stages (Migrants will make stops in the way to their final destination).

Guest Worker: A migrant who may temporarily migrate to a new country for work or educational reasons. These people might send back money to their home country, which is called remittance.

Remittance: Money an immigrant sends back to their family residing in their home country.

Transhumance Migration: Migration that is cyclical and revolves around the seasonal movement of livestock.

Rural to Urban Migration: Movement of people from rural settlements to urban settlements.

Intraregional Migration: Migration that involves a permanent move within the same region.

Interregional Migration: Migration that involves a permanent move from one region of a country to another region of the same country.

Unit 2 Topic 12 (2.12):

[How Migration Impacts Society [AP Human Geography Unit 2 Topic 12]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LA-7-S3cts)

Political Effects of Migration: Some governments restrict migration based on their needs. Every country has various migration needs. This impacts the way they take care of the migrant and also impacts the number of immigrants entering the country.

Economic Effects of Migration: Immigrants help increase the economy and develop new businesses. If a country has a low economy, then it will experience a brain drain which is when people emigrate from the country to get a better job in a different country.  Some countries give guest workers visas to fill in the missing job gaps in the country.

Cultural Effects on Migration: More migrants mean more cultural diversity, but this may also mean the seriousness of a specific culture might not be as concentrated as it was before. This also means that more people might lose their jobs due to more migrants entering the country.
