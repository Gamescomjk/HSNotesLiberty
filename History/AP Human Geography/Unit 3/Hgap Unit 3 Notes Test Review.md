Culture:

Material Culture: Objects that people and/or society give value to. (Physical things that you can buy, wear, use)

Non-Material Culture: Consists of the ideas and/or beliefs an individual or society has. (Non-physical things like ideas, shared practices, or beliefs.

Subculture: A smaller group within a larger culture.

Modern Culture (Pop Culture): Often in more developed countries and mostly diffuse by hierarchical diffusion. This is a more diverse culture and is made up of many different parts that change over time.

Folk Culture: More of a homogenous culture and diffuses due to relocation. Family and religion play a major role in this kind of culture.

Indigenous Culture: Distinct social and cultural groups that share collective ancestral ties to the lands and natural resources where they live, occupy or from which they have been displaced.

Ethnocentrism: The practice of analyzing or judging a culture by the standards of one’s own culture. This can cause people to look down on a culture. This could possibly lead to xenophobia, prejudice, negative stereotypes, or a general misunderstanding of the culture.

Cultural Relativism: The practice of analyzing or judging a culture by its own standards. The individual does not judge the culture based on their own cultural standards. Often allows an individual to gain a better understanding of the culture.

In brief, Ethnocentrism is when a person applies their cultural standards to another culture and cultural relativism is when a person views another culture from that culture’s perspective.

[How Centripetal and Centrifugal Forces Impact A Place [AP Human Geography Unit 3 Topic 3]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPnDVuyzJI4)

Sense of Place: A strong feeling or perception people have of a place.

Placemaking: The process of a community coming together and transforming a public space for different activities or events.

Public projects look at various data regarding where people are doing most recreational activities.

Centripetal Forces: Forces that unite people and bring people together like having a common language, a strong sense of identity nationalism or a homogenous United communities.

Centrifugal Forces: Forces that divide a group of people and push them apart for example if a place is geographically large and as people spread out over large distances, it may make it harder to communicate or keep one cohesive identity.

In general, Centripetal Forces are forces that bring a community together where as Centrifugal Forces are forces that divide a community and we will see people not interacting with other in societies that have more of Centrifugal Forces.

Unit 3 Topic 4 (3.4):

[Types of Diffusion [AP Human Geography Unit 3 Topic 4]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbzDulxR1ww)

Diffusion: The spread of a cultural element, item, group of people, disease, or phenomenon from one place to another.

Hearth: The location in which an idea, culture, or belief or item is originated.

Types of Diffusions: Relocation Diffusion, Expansion Diffusion

Relocation Diffusion: When a group of people physically move together.The hearth will often start to shrink since people are starting to relocate.

Expansion Diffusion: Here the hearth is often strong since people start to expand outwards from the hearthbut not relocate from the hearth.

There again are multiple types of diffusions, which are hierarchical diffusion, contagious diffusion, and stimulus diffusion.

Hierarchical Diffusion: Often happens through systems like fashion trends. Example: Mr. Beast playing Apex, which makes other content creators play the game too leading more influencers playing the game to make more people play the game.

Contagious diffusion: When a trend starts and immediately spreads. Like the squid game remake Mr. Beast made and how it blew up the internet and everyone came to know about it.

Stimulus Diffusion: As diffusion occurs we can see tha trait take up different aspects of the environment or culture it is diffusing.

Barriers to diffusion: Like a language barrier between two places which will make it harder for people from both the places to communicate.

Unit 3 Topic 6 (3.6):

[Contemporary Causes Of Diffusion [AP Human Geography Unit 3 Topic 6]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZSgp2thkQs&t=230s)

Technological advancements made communication easier with other countries easier than before and helps people communicate with the workforce by working from home.

This diffusion might lead to the diffusion of various cultures.

-   Cultural Divergence - When individuals become separated from different aspects of their culture.
    

-   May lead people to abandon certain cultural traits.
    

-   Cultural Convergence - When different cultures merge together to form one mass culture.
    

-   Often times in the form of modern or global culture.
    

Both happen due to improved access and communication in society.

Globalization is another part promoting diffusion as well.

Diffusion can gradually shift from a global, to national or happen the other way around due to diffusion.
