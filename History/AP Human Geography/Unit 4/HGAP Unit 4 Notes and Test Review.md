Unit 4 Topic 4 (4.4):

[Defining Political & Cultural Boundaries [AP Human Geography Unit 4 Topic 4] (4.4)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M349S8uFwZI&list=PL-R0qM-A09uzmvZjW5_-aYI9AsvJqFwWr&index=6)

A boundary is an invisible line separating one state from another. It could separate religions or ethnicities as well.

Physical Boundary. A boundary that goes with a natural landscape.

Antecedent Boundary: Boundaries existing based on the physical environment.

Relic Boundaries: They don't exist anymore and are no longer in use, but they still have an effect on the current cultural landscape. An example could be when Yugoslavia broke up due to conflict between the different nations. After the state broke up, new boundaries were created based on the different ethnic groups in the region.

Subsequent boundary: Made of different cultures already residing in the area.

Consequent boundaries: Utilized to be able to separate different groups. (partition of India as an example of separating the Hindus and the Muslims).

Superimposed boundaries: Put in place by a foreign state. Take Scramble for Africa as an example.

Frontier: Areas where boundaries are poorly enforced. No country has a strong power over the boundary. An example would be Antarctica.

[Devolutionary Factors & Power [AP Human Geography Unit 4 Topic 8] (4.8)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDfGB1kVi1E&list=PL-R0qM-A09uzmvZjW5_-aYI9AsvJqFwWr&index=11)

There are a variety of different devolutionary factors like:

-   Environmental Factors - States that are geographically large can see unique cultures form throughout the state.
    
-   Cultural Factors - States that are culturally diverse, have different ethnic groups and nations and groups with a history of self-determination that haven’t connected into the state’s culture are more likely to see devolution occur as well.
    
-   Multiple Factors
