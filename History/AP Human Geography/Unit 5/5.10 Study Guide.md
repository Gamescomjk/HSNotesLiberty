## Environmental Effects of Agriculture 

-   Overgrazing 
    

-   Overgrazing is the excessive use of grazing land by livestock, which can lead to the degradation of the land. It occurs when the number of livestock that are allowed to graze on a piece of land exceeds the land's carrying capacity, or the maximum number of animals that the land can support without degradation.  
    To prevent overgrazing, it is important to properly manage grazing land and ensure that the number of livestock that are allowed to graze on a piece of land does not exceed the land's carrying capacity. This can be achieved through the use of rotational grazing, fencing, and other management practices.
    
-   Overgrazing can have a range of negative impacts on the environment, including soil erosion, vegetation loss, and water quality degradation. It can also reduce the productivity of the land and the number of livestock that it can support, which can have economic implications for farmers and ranchers.
    
-   Overgrazing is often a result of a lack of proper management, such as inadequate fencing or lack of rotational grazing. It can also be caused by factors such as population growth, drought, or changes in land use.
    

-   Desertification 
    

-   Desertification is the process by which fertile land becomes desert-like, due to a variety of factors, such as climate change, overuse, and poor land management practices. It is a serious problem that affects many regions around the world and can have a range of negative impacts, including loss of productivity, increased poverty, and social and political instability.  
    There are several factors that can contribute to desertification, including:
    

-   Climate change: Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns can lead to desertification by altering the balance of water and nutrients in the soil.
    
-   Overuse: Excessive use of land, such as overgrazing, can lead to desertification by depleting the soil of nutrients and causing erosion.
    
-   Poor land management practices: Unsustainable land management practices, such as the overuse of pesticides and fertilizers, can also contribute to desertification.
    
-   Deforestation: The removal of trees, which are important for maintaining soil moisture and fertility, can also contribute to desertification.
    

-   To combat desertification, it is important to adopt sustainable land management practices, such as rotational grazing, the use of cover crops, and the conservation of soil moisture. It is also important to address the underlying causes of desertification, such as climate change and deforestation.
    

-   Overfishing 
    

-   Overfishing is the removal of a species of fish from a body of water at a rate that the species cannot replenish, resulting in those species becoming underpopulated in that area. This can lead to a decline in the overall health of the ecosystem and cause imbalances in the food chain. Overfishing can occur in both freshwater and marine environments and can have a number of negative consequences, including reduced biodiversity, habitat destruction, and economic losses for fishers. To address the issue of overfishing, it is important for fishers to practice sustainable fishing techniques, and for governments to regulate the fishing industry and implement policies to protect fish populations.
    

-   Pesticides 
    

-   DDT is a major example 
    
-   Have harmed wildlife and polluted our waters 
    

-   Soil Salinization 
    

-   Soil salinization occurs when soil becomes too salty, which can make it difficult or impossible for plants to grow. This can be caused by a number of factors, including irrigation with salty water, improper drainage, and high levels of naturally occurring salts in the soil.
    
-   When soil becomes saline, it can lead to a decline in crop yields and the overall productivity of the land. It can also make it difficult for farmers to grow crops that are sensitive to salt, such as most fruit trees and many vegetables. In addition, soil salinization can cause environmental problems, such as the loss of biodiversity and the degradation of ecosystems.
    
-   To address soil salinization, farmers can use irrigation techniques that minimize the buildup of salts in the soil, such as drip irrigation and subsurface irrigation. They can also use leaching techniques to remove excess salts from the soil and plant salt-tolerant crops. In addition, policymakers can implement policies to encourage the use of sustainable irrigation practices and promote the use of salt-tolerant crops.
    

-   Pollution 
    
-   Conservation efforts (to preserve the environment) 
    

-   There are many different conservation efforts that can be undertaken to preserve the environment and protect natural resources. Some examples include:
    

-   Protecting and restoring natural habitats, such as forests, wetlands, and grasslands
    
-   Implementing sustainable land use practices, such as conservation tillage and cover cropping
    
-   Protecting endangered species and threatened ecosystems through legislation and conservation programs
    
-   Promoting the use of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change
    
-   Reducing the use of pesticides and fertilizers to protect water quality and reduce environmental pollution
    
-   Recycling and waste reduction to reduce the amount of resources used and minimize waste
    
-   Promoting sustainable transportation, such as the use of public transportation and electric or hybrid vehicles, to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions
    
-   Supporting sustainable agriculture and fisheries to ensure that these industries are environmentally responsible and sustainable.
    

### Changing the Physical Landscape

-   Slash and burn/Shifting Cultivation
    

-   Slash and burn, also known as shifting cultivation, is a type of subsistence agriculture in which land is cleared by cutting and burning vegetation. Crops are then planted in the cleared land, and the land is used for a few years until the soil becomes less fertile. The farmers then move on to a new piece of land, clearing and burning it in the same way.
    
-   Slash and burn agriculture is practiced in many parts of the world, particularly in tropical areas with high rainfall. It is often used by small-scale farmers who do not have access to modern farming techniques or resources.
    
-   While slash and burn agriculture can be a useful way for small farmers to produce food, it can also have negative impacts on the environment. The clearing of land through burning releases large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change. It can also lead to soil erosion and degradation, as well as habitat destruction and loss of biodiversity. To minimize the negative impacts of slash and burn agriculture, it is important for farmers to adopt sustainable land use practices and to work in cooperation with local governments and organizations to protect natural resources.
    

-   Terrace Farming 
    

-   Terrace farming is a type of agriculture in which land is divided into a series of terraces, or flat areas of land that are separated by banks or walls. These terraces are used to grow crops, and they are often found on hillsides or mountainous areas where the slope of the land makes traditional farming techniques difficult.
    
-   Terrace farming has a number of benefits compared to traditional farming methods. It allows farmers to grow crops on land that would otherwise be too steep or rocky to cultivate, and it can help to reduce soil erosion by slowing the flow of water down a slope. In addition, terraces can help to capture and retain moisture, making it easier to grow crops in dry or drought-prone areas.
    
-   However, terrace farming can also be labor-intensive and costly, as it requires the construction of terraces and irrigation systems. In addition, terraces can be vulnerable to landslides and other natural disasters if not properly maintained. To maximize the benefits of terrace farming, it is important for farmers to adopt sustainable land use practices and to properly maintain their terraces to ensure their long-term stability.
    

-   Irrigation 
    

-   Irrigation is the process of supplying water to crops to help them grow. It is commonly used in areas where natural rainfall is insufficient to support crop growth, or where there are fluctuations in the amount of rainfall from year to year.
    
-   There are many different methods of irrigation, including surface irrigation, in which water is applied to the surface of the soil and allowed to flow naturally through the field; sprinkler irrigation, in which water is sprayed onto the crops using a system of pipes and sprinklers; and drip irrigation, in which water is delivered directly to the roots of the plants through a network of tubes.
    
-   Irrigation can be an important tool for increasing agricultural productivity and helping to feed a growing population. However, it can also have negative impacts on the environment if it is not managed properly. Overuse of irrigation can lead to water shortages and the depletion of groundwater reserves, and it can also contribute to soil salinization and water pollution if chemicals from fertilizers and pesticides are applied at the same time as the water. To minimize the negative impacts of irrigation, it is important for farmers to use water efficiently and to adopt sustainable irrigation practices.

-   Done to increase farmland but...
    
-   Decreases biodiversity in plants and animals 
    

-   Pastoral Nomadism 
    

-   Pastoral nomadism is a type of subsistence agriculture in which people rely on the raising of livestock, such as goats, sheep, and camels, as their primary source of food and income. Pastoral nomads typically move their herds to different areas in search of pasture and water, and they often live a semi-nomadic or nomadic lifestyle, traveling with their herds from place to place.
    
-   Pastoral nomadism is practiced in many parts of the world, including Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. It is a way of life that has been practiced for thousands of years, and it is often well-suited to the arid and semi-arid regions where pastoral nomads live.
    
-   Pastoral nomadism can have both positive and negative impacts on the environment. On the one hand, pastoral nomads often have a low impact on the environment, as they rely on the natural resources of the land and do not use large amounts of pesticides or fertilizers. On the other hand, overgrazing by livestock can lead to soil erosion and desertification, and the movement of large herds of animals can disrupt the natural ecosystems of an area. To minimize the negative impacts of pastoral nomadism, it is important for pastoral nomads to practice sustainable livestock management and to work in cooperation with local governments and organizations to protect natural resources.
    

### Societal Effects of Agriculture 

-   Changing diets 
    
-   Role of women in agriculture production and consumption
    

-   Food gathering -> farming -> managing agribusiness 
    
-   Different types of food are being consumed (would you like pomegranate, some coffee, or perhaps some edamame?) 
    
-   Food is being prepared in new ways (mmm stir fried veggies!) 
    

-   The purpose of agriculture (geared towards the economy) 
    

-   Although agriculture was once geared toward individual consumption, it has since shifted to global consumption. Agriculture has become a necessary component of our economy and the purpose of agriculture has become increasingly focused on profits.
