## Debates Surrounding Agricultural Innovations

*These innovations have raised questions about their sustainability, soil and water usage, effect on biodiversity, and extensive use of chemicals. 

### Biotechnology 

Definition

Biotechnology is the use of living organisms or their products to develop or make products or technologies. Biotechnology has a wide range of applications, including agriculture, medicine, environmental management, and industry.

In agriculture, biotechnology is used to develop crops that are resistant to pests and diseases, tolerate drought and other environmental stresses, and have improved nutritional content. This can help to increase crop yields and reduce the need for chemical inputs, such as pesticides and fertilizers.

In medicine, biotechnology is used to develop new drugs, diagnostic tests, and therapies. This can help to improve the treatment of diseases and improve public health.

In environmental management, biotechnology is used to develop technologies that help to clean up contaminated sites, reduce pollution, and conserve natural resources.

In industry, biotechnology is used to produce a variety of products, such as biofuels, bioplastics, and industrial enzymes.

Some examples of biotechnology include genetic engineering, fermentation, and tissue culture. Biotechnology has the potential to revolutionize many different fields, but it is also a controversial area, and there are concerns about the safety and ethical implications of some biotechnology applications.

Arguments for: 

-   More efficient crop production 
    
-   Prolonged freshness of products 
    
-   Can design/modify organisms for specific purposes 
    

Arguments against: 

-   Consuming large amounts of GMO foods could reduce the effectiveness of antibiotics and affect the ecological balance of agriculture 
    
-   Genetically modified plants and animals could interbreed and contaminate food supplies 
    

### GMOs 

Definition

GMOs, or genetically modified organisms, are living organisms that have had their DNA modified using biotechnology techniques. The genetic material of a GMO is altered in a way that does not occur naturally, usually by adding or removing specific genes.

GMOs are used in a variety of applications, including agriculture, medicine, and industry. In agriculture, GMOs are used to develop crops that are resistant to pests and diseases, tolerate environmental stresses, and have improved nutritional content. This can help to increase crop yields and reduce the need for chemical inputs, such as pesticides and fertilizers.

GMOs are controversial, and there are ongoing debates about their safety, environmental impacts, and ethical implications. Some people are concerned about the potential risks of GMOs, such as the potential for unintended consequences and the potential for harm to human health or the environment. Others argue that GMOs can have many benefits, such as increasing food security and reducing the environmental impact of agriculture.

The use of GMOs is regulated by governments around the world, and there are labeling requirements for food products that contain GMOs in some countries. However, there are different approaches to regulating GMOs, and the regulations vary by country.

Arguments for: 

-   Higher yields 
    
-   More nutrient dense varieties 
    
-   Resistant to pests 
    
-   Tolerant to droughts 
    
-   Tolerant to herbicides 
    

Arguments against: 

Environmental hazards 

-   Unwanted gene transfer to other organisms 
    
-   Unintended harm to other organisms 
    

Human health risk 

-   Unknown or unintended health effects 
    
-   Economic concerns 
    

Patents by agrichemical companies 

-   GMOs are more expensive to produce and take longer to bring into the market 
    

### Aquaculture 

Definition

Aquaculture is the farming of aquatic organisms, such as fish, shellfish, and seaweed. It is an important source of food and other products, such as fishmeal, fish oil, and pearls.

Aquaculture can be practiced in a variety of aquatic environments, including fresh water, salt water, and brackish water. There are many different species of aquatic organisms that are farmed, including finfish, shellfish, seaweed, and algae.

Aquaculture can be carried out in a variety of systems, including ponds, tanks, cages, and raceways. It can be practiced on a small scale, such as in backyard ponds, or on a large scale, such as in offshore cages.

Aquaculture is an important source of food and other products, and it can help to meet the growing demand for seafood. However, it is also a controversial industry, and there are concerns about the environmental impacts of aquaculture, such as pollution, habitat destruction, and the spread of diseases and parasites. There are also concerns about the welfare of farmed aquatic animals and the use of wild fish as feed in some aquaculture systems.

Arguments for: 

-   Fish and marine plants can be used to rebuild species populations 
    
-   Plants grown in aquaculture provide material that can be used for pharmaceutical nutritional, and biotechnology purposes 
    
-   Could be used for treating sewage and wastewater (by using fish like prawns and carp that gain nutrients from waste) 
    

Arguments against: 

-   Can lead to overfishing 
    
-   Certain fish species can become extinct 
    
-   Marine ecosystems can be affecting by upsetting the food chain 
    
-   Can pollute water systems (due to large concentrations of fish) 
    
-   Can change the landscape for marine life 
    
-   Expensive practice 
    

### Influences on Food Production and Consumption

What we choose to eat greatly affects food production and consumption patterns, and there are plenty of “movements” related to individual food choices that influence these patterns, such as urban farming, community-supported agriculture (CSA), organic farming, value added specialty crops, fair trade, local-food movements, and dietary shifts. 

-   Community-Supported Agriculture (CSA) 
    

-   A network or association of individuals who have agreed to support one or more local farms 
    
-   Both growers and consumers share the upsides and downsides that come with food production 
    

-   Organic Farming 
    

-   No genetically modified organisms 
    
-   No artificial/harsh chemicals (pesticides, antibiotics, fertilizers, synthetic hormones) 
    
-   Less costly to grow 
    
-   Has little effect on the production of staple foods 
    
-   Questionable standards and sustainability 
    
-   Prices out smaller farms because subsidies favor larger farms with more diverse ecosystems (since chemicals can’t be used)
    

-   Value-added Specialty Crops 
    

-   These have something “special” in them that makes them unique and priced higher 
    

-   Something different in the production of the product that “enhances its value” 
    

-   Examples: 
    

-   Organically produced (oftentimes seen as “better,” so people are willing to purchase it at a higher price) 
    
-   Jams (these are special because fruits are changed into something delicious in production) 
    
-   Cotton-candy grapes (the name itself says specialty, and you don’t find them everywhere either! side note- you must try these when they’re in season!) 
    

-   Fair Trade 
    

-   Promotes sustainability 
    
-   Fair everything! (Emphasizes small business) 
    

-   Fair worker wages 
    
-   Permits union organizing 
    
-   Must comply with minimum environmental and safety hazards 
    

-   When you see “fair trade” on product labels, this means that the product producers are getting a fair price for their goods 
    

-   Local Food Movements 
    

-   Local farmers markets 
    

-   Food is the main attraction, but they also provide a sense of community and are generally an enjoyable, fun experience 
    

### Food for All (What’s wrong with this?) 

*You should know the challenges of trying to feed an entire world’s worth of population (7 billion people is a lot!) 

-   Lack of/Unequal Food Access 
    

-   Food insecurity 
    

-   Plenty of children and families around the world are food insecure 
    
-   It means sparse physical, social, or economic access to healthy food needed to meet dietary standards  
    

-   Food deserts 
    

-   Areas with very little access to (or even no access to) nutritious, affordable food such as fresh fruits and vegetables 
    
-   *Know this: There are areas only surrounded by fast food restaurants and run-down gas stations -> how are people in poverty supposed to stay healthy, let alone afford this?! 
    

-   Issues with Distribution Systems 
    

-   Certain areas may receive more product than others, which is especially unfavorable to those living in remote, isolated regions
    

-   Unpredictable/Unfavorable Weather Conditions
    

-   Food may not reach these areas as readily
    
-   Farmlands may be located very far away, making it difficult for regions located in harsh climates to get access to fresh produce 
    

-   Suburbanization 
    

-   Results in loss of land, and as a result, decreased farmland and crop production 
    

### What Economic Processes Affect Food-Production? 

There are several economic processes that can affect food production, including:

1.  Supply and demand: The basic economic principle of supply and demand can affect the production of food. If there is a high demand for a particular type of food and a low supply, the price of that food will tend to increase, which can incentivize producers to increase production. On the other hand, if there is a low demand and a high supply, the price will tend to decrease, which can discourage producers from producing that food.
    
2.  Production costs: The costs of producing food, such as labor, land, and inputs, can also affect food production. If the costs of production are high, it may not be profitable for producers to grow certain types of food, which can lead to a reduction in production.
    
3.  Government policies: Government policies, such as subsidies, tariffs, and regulations, can also affect food production. For example, subsidies can make it more profitable for producers to grow certain types of food, while tariffs can make it more expensive to import food from other countries, which can encourage domestic production.
    
4.  Market conditions: Market conditions, such as competition, prices of related goods, and consumer preferences, can also affect food production. For example, if there is strong competition among producers, it may be necessary to reduce prices in order to sell goods, which can affect profitability.
    
5.  Natural disasters: Natural disasters, such as droughts, floods, and hurricanes, can also affect food production. These disasters can damage crops and livestock and disrupt supply chains, which can lead to a reduction in food production.
    

To put it simply, you should know that the way food is produced is largely determined by the location of food-processing facilities, economies of scale, distribution systems, and government policies.
