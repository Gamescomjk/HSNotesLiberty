## Regions of Agricultural Production

Agricultural production regions are areas of the world that are characterized by high levels of agricultural activity. These regions typically have the right combination of climate, soil, and water resources to support the growth of crops and livestock. Some of the major agricultural production regions of the world include:

1.  The Midwest United States: This region is known for its fertile soil and is a major producer of crops such as corn, wheat, and soybeans.
    
2.  The Prairie Provinces of Canada: This region has a temperate climate and is a major producer of wheat, canola, and other grains.
    
3.  The Yangtze River Valley in China: This region has a humid, subtropical climate and is a major producer of rice, wheat, and other crops.
    
4.  The Po Valley in Italy: This region has a Mediterranean climate and is a major producer of wheat, rice, and other grains.
    
5.  The Pampas in Argentina: This region has a temperate climate and is a major producer of wheat, corn, and soybeans.
    
6.  The Midwest and Great Plains regions of Brazil: This region has a tropical climate and is a major producer of soybeans, corn, and other crops.
    

### Subsistence Farming

Subsistence farming tends to occur in LDCs (less developed countries), where farmers tend to focus on producing food for themselves rather than for profit. They grow crops and raise animals to provide food for themselves and their family in order to survive and aren’t intended to be sold in markets. 

Here is an example of subsistence farming:

In rural Nepal, a family of five relies on their small plot of land to grow rice, wheat, and vegetables. They have a few goats and chickens, which provide milk and eggs for the family. The family works hard to grow enough food to feed themselves and to have a little left over to sell at the local market. They do not have access to irrigation, so they rely on the monsoon rains to water their crops. They also use traditional farming techniques, such as terracing and composting, to make the most of their limited resources. The family's farm provides them with a basic level of food security, but they do not have the resources to diversify their crops or to expand their farm.

### Commercial Farming

Commercial farming is a type of agriculture that is focused on producing crops or livestock for sale in the market. Commercial farmers typically grow a wide range of crops or raise a variety of livestock, and use modern techniques and technologies to increase efficiency and maximize profits.

Commercial farming is distinguished from small-scale or subsistence farming, in which farmers grow crops or raise livestock primarily for their own consumption or for sale to local markets. Commercial farmers often operate on a larger scale and may sell their products to markets both within and outside their local region.

Commercial farming can have both positive and negative impacts on the environment, local communities, and the global food system. On the one hand, it can help to increase food production and contribute to economic development. It can also lead to environmental degradation, such as soil erosion and water pollution, and may contribute to the displacement of small farmers in favor of larger, more mechanized operations.

Here is an example of commercial farming:

In the United States, a large farm in California grows almonds, a lucrative cash crop. The farm has access to irrigation and uses advanced farming techniques, such as precision farming and pest control, to maximize yield. The farm also has a team of workers who are responsible for planting, pruning, and harvesting the trees. The almonds are then packaged and shipped to markets around the world. The farm generates a significant profit, which is used to reinvest in the business and to pay the workers. The farm's owners also have the resources to diversify their crops and to invest in new ventures, such as processing and marketing.

### Monocropping/Monoculture

Monocropping, also known as monoculture, is the practice of growing a single crop species over a large area. This can be done for a variety of reasons, including to maximize efficiency and profits, or to take advantage of specific soil or climatic conditions.

Monoculture can have some benefits, such as increased efficiency and productivity, and reduced costs for farmers. However, it can also have negative impacts on the environment and the local ecosystem. For example, monoculture can lead to soil degradation and erosion, as the same type of crop is grown in the same soil year after year without being rotated with other crops. Monoculture can also make crops more vulnerable to pests and diseases, as there is a lack of biodiversity in the field.

To mitigate the negative impacts of monoculture, some farmers have adopted practices such as crop rotation, in which different crops are grown in the same field in different years, or intercropping, in which multiple crops are grown together in the same field. These practices can help to improve soil health and reduce the risk of pests and diseases.

Some examples of monoculture crops include:

1.  Corn: In many parts of the world, corn is grown as a monoculture crop, particularly in the United States, where it is the most widely produced crop.
    
2.  Wheat: Wheat is often grown as a monoculture crop in regions with temperate climates, such as the Prairie Provinces of Canada and the Midwest United States.
    
3.  Soybeans: Soybeans are commonly grown as a monoculture crop in Brazil and the United States, particularly in the Midwest.
    
4.  Rice: Rice is often grown as a monoculture crop in parts of Asia, particularly in the Yangtze River Valley of China and the Mekong Delta of Vietnam.
    
5.  Cotton: Cotton is often grown as a monoculture crop in parts of the United States, such as the Southwest, as well as in countries such as India, China, and Pakistan.
    
6.  Palm oil: Palm oil is often grown as a monoculture crop in tropical regions, particularly in Indonesia and Malaysia.
    

### Bid-Rent Theory 

Bid-rent theory is a model that explains the relationship between the value of land and its distance from the central business district (CBD) of a city. According to bid-rent theory, as the distance from the CBD increases, the value of land decreases. This is because land closer to the CBD is more valuable due to its proximity to amenities, such as jobs, transportation, and other resources.

The bid-rent theory is often used to predict the location of land uses within a city. For example, it can be used to predict that high-value uses, such as office buildings, will be located closer to the CBD, while lower-value uses, such as industrial or agricultural land, will be located farther from the CBD.

Bid-rent theory is often used in the field of urban and regional planning to understand how land is used and valued in different parts of a city. It is also used in real estate to predict land values and inform investment decisions.

Here is an example of the bid rent theory in action:

In a city, the land near the downtown area is more expensive than land on the outskirts because it has a higher potential for development. For example, a developer might be willing to pay a higher price for a plot of land in the city center because they can build a high-rise apartment building, which generates a higher return on investment than a low-rise building on the outskirts. The developer is willing to pay a "bid rent" for the land because they expect to make a profit from the development. On the other hand, a farmer might be willing to pay a lower price for land on the outskirts of the city because they can use it for agriculture, which does not generate as high a return on investment.

### Key Points

-   Commerce will situate in the inner core of the city 
    

-   Will pay higher rent for the “prime spot” 
    
-   Greater accessibility = more opportunity to attract a large population to their businesses 
    

-   Industry will situate further away from the CBD 
    

-   They need more land for a lower price/rent  
    
-   Want low price without being too far removed from the marketplace 
    

-   Residentials 
    

-   Don’t care as much about the market → more about how much they can pay for the commuting distance 
    

-   The poor reside closer to the city to get to their jobs easily 
    

-   Assumptions of the theory 
    

-   The land is featureless (i.e. no physical land features that could impact the cost or time or commuting) 
    
-   Cost of rent increases directly with the distance from the CBD 
    
-   Most centers for employment are located in the CBd while the rest is spread throughout the metropolitan area
