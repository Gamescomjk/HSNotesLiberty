THOUGHTS = What a character thinks, believes, values, and what motivates a character. 

EFFECTS on OTHERS = The relationships the character has with others and how characters treat each other.  

ACTIONS = How a character behaves, including how they react to people & events.

SPEAK:

"Hunting tigers ceased to interest me some years ago. I exhausted their possibilities, you see. No thrill left in tigers, no real danger. I live for danger, Mr. Rainsford." (Connel, 6)

  

Many noble Russians lost everything. I, luckily, had invested heavily in American securities, so I shall never have to open a tearoom in Monte Carlo or drive a taxi in Paris.

This tells us that Zaroff is a brave and daring because if giant tigers don't exticetice him

  
  
  
  
  
  

He had been financially responsible and predicted that american securities would be a good investment 

THOUGHTS

  

"Life is for the strong, to be lived by the strong, and, if needs be, taken by the strong. The weak of the world were put here to give the strong pleasure. I am strong. Why should I not use my gift? If I wish to hunt, why should I not? 

  
  

A motto that the genranal lives by 

EFFECTS:

  

  

ACTIONS:

The general took from his pocket a gold cigarette case and offered his guest a long black cigarette with a silver tip; it was perfumed and gave off a smell like incense. (Connel, 6)

Even simple items like cigarettes he has in gold cases. Meaning that he is rich. 

LOOKS:

Rainsford's first impression was that the man was singularly handsome; his second was that there was an original, almost bizarre quality about the general's face. He was a tall man past middle age, for his hair was a vivid white; but his thick eyebrows and pointed military mustache were as black as the night from which Rainsford had come. His eyes, too, were black and very bright. He had high cheekbones, a sharpcut nose, a spare, dark face--the face of a man used to giving orders, the face of an aristocrat. Turning to the giant in uniform, the general made a sign. The giant put away his pistol, saluted, and withdrew. (Connell, 4) 

He has a good body but he is old, So he must workout alot/

SPEAK

  

Rainsford did not smile. "I am still a beast at bay," he said, in a low, hoarse voice. "Get ready, General Zaroff."

Rainsfords tone while speaking to the general in

THOUGHTS:

An abrupt sound startled him. Off to the right he heard it, and his ears, expert in such matters, could not be mistaken. Again he heard the sound, and again. Somewhere, off in the blackness, someone had fired a gun three times. (Connel, 2)

  
  
  

"Where there are pistol shots, there are men. Where there are men, there is food," he thought. But what kind of men, he wondered, forbid a place? An unbroken front of snarled and ragged jungle fringed the shore. 

Rainsford is self aware of his surroundings

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

He Knows a good amount of knowledge.

EFFECTS:

Laughter shook the general. "How extraordinarily droll you are!" he said. "One does not expect nowadays to find a young man of the educated class, even in America, with such a naive, and, if I may say so, midVictorian point of view. It's like finding a snuffbox in a limousine. Ah, well, doubtless you had Puritan ancestors. So many Americans appear to have had. I'll wager you'll forget your notions when you go hunting with me. 

  
  

"Civilized? And you shoot down men?" 

Made rainsford very uncomfreatble due to the reaction given by the general

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

Rainsford is being very logical, because shooting people as a hobby would be considered curel, and this angers rainsford

ACTIONS:

There was a chance that his cries could be heard by someone aboard the yacht, but that chance was slender and grew morre yacht raced on. He wrestled himself out of his clothes and shouted with all his power. The lights of the yacht became faint and ever-vanishing fireflies; then they were blotted out entirely by the night. (Connel, 2)

  

LOOKS:

he swam in that direction, swimming with slow, deliberate strokes, conserving his strength

  

Ten minutes of determined effort.

Has Strong muscles and high amount of stamina.
