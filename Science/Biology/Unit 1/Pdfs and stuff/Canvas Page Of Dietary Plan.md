# Dietary Plan

You will be given a patient report from physicians at the Cowger Family Care Practice that describe symptoms and possible ailments their patients are dealing with. You, as the **_amazing_** dietician teams you are, will determine why the patient is experiencing these symptoms **and** create a meal plan that will address the patients need. In the plan, you must also justify why you selected certain food options based on the amount and functions of the biomolecules found in each of them to assist the patient.

How you choose to organize this information is up to you. It can be as a pamphlet, an infographic, or just a **SHORT** report for the patient and the doctor. As long as you clearly and concisely communicate everything to the doctor and patient, you're all set!
