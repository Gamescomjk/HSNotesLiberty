Scientific Fact Vs Theory

The process of becoming a scientific theory

Every scientific theory starts as a hypothesis. According to the [Merriam-Webster Dictionary](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hypothesis), a hypothesis is an idea that hasn't been proven yet. If enough evidence accumulates to support a [hypothesis](http://www.livescience.com/21490-what-is-a-scientific-hypothesis-definition-of-hypothesis.html), it moves to the next step — known as a theory — in the [scientific method](http://www.livescience.com/20896-science-scientific-method.html) and becomes accepted as a valid explanation of a phenomenon.  

Theories may change, or the way that they are interpreted may change, but the facts themselves don’t change.

[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/scientific+fact](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/scientific+fact)

Scientific Fact: any observation that has been repeatedly confirmed and accepted as true; any scientific observation that has not been refuted 

Examples: The structure of a cell membrane is considered a scientific fact. 

  

Any scientific theory must be based on a careful and rational examination of the facts. Facts and theories are two different things. In the scientific method, there is a clear distinction between facts, which can be observed and/or measured, and theories, which are scientists’ explanations and interpretations of the facts.
